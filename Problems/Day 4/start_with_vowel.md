## **Count Words Starting with Vowels**

Write a Python program that takes in a list of words and prints the number of words in the list that start with a vowel. The program should take a list of words as input, count the number of words in the list that start with a vowel, and print the count to the console.

**Input:**
```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "elephant", "igloo"]
count_vowel_words(words)
```


**Output:**
```python
2
```



 **Constraints:**
- The input list will contain only strings.
- Words in the input list may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Your program should count words that start with any vowel, including "a", "e", "i", "o", and "u".
- Your program should print the count to the console.

 **Concepts Practised:**
- Loops: using loops to iterate over lists or other data structures.
- Conditional statements: using if/else statements to check conditions and perform different actions based on those conditions.
- String manipulation: creating and manipulating strings using Python's string methods.
- Functions: writing functions to encapsulate blocks of code that can be reused in the program.
