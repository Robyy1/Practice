## **Prime Number Generator**

Write a Python program that generates prime numbers within a given range of integers.

**Input**

Two integers, `start` and `end`, where `start` <= `end` represent the range within which prime numbers are to be generated.

```python
# Two integers, start and end, where start <= end represent the range within which prime numbers are to be generated.
start = 10
end = 50

# Your code
...

prime_numbers = generate_prime_numbers(start, end)
print(prime_numbers)
```



**Output**

A list of prime numbers within the specified range.

```python
[11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
```


**Constraints**

- Prime numbers are positive integers greater than 1 that are divisible by only 1 and themselves.
- The input range start and end are inclusive, meaning both start and end are included in the range.
- If there are no prime numbers within the given range, return an empty list.
- You may use any suitable algorithm for generating prime numbers, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes or trial division method.
