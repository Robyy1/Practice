## **Replace Vowels with "x"**

Write a Python program that takes in a string and replaces all the vowels with the letter "x". The program should take a string as input, replace all the vowels with "x", and modify the original string. The modified string should then be printed to the console.

**Input:**
```python
string = "Hello, World!"
replace_vowels(string)
print(string)
```



**Output:**
```python
"Hxllx, Wxrld!"
```


**Constraints:**
- The input string will contain only alphabetic characters and spaces.
- Your program should modify the original string and not create a new string.
- Your program should not return anything, but should print the modified string to the console.

**Concepts Practised:**
- String manipulation: creating and manipulating strings using Python's string methods.
- Loops: using loops to iterate over strings or other data structures.
- Conditional statements: using if/else statements to check conditions and perform different actions based on those conditions.
- Functions: writing functions to encapsulate blocks of code that can be reused in the program.
