## **Project Idea: Hangman Game**

The Hangman Game is a Python program that allows users to play the classic game of hangman. The game randomly selects a word from a list, and the player must guess the letters in the word before running out of guesses.

**Features:**
- The game selects a random word from a list of words, which can be customized to include different categories such as animals, countries, or sports teams.
- The player is given a limited number of guesses to guess the word.
- The program displays the current state of the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses.
- The program tracks the player's score and displays it at the end of each game.
- The program allows players to play multiple rounds and keeps track of their high score.

**Concepts Practiced:**
- Random number generation: using Python's built-in random number generator to select a random word from a list.
- String manipulation: using string methods to manipulate the selected word and the player's guesses.
- Loops: using loops to iterate over strings, lists, or other data structures.
- Conditional statements: using if/else statements to check conditions and perform different actions based on those conditions.
- Functions: writing functions to encapsulate blocks of code that can be reused in the program.
- Input/output: getting input from the user and displaying output to the user using Python's input and print functions.
- Error handling: handling errors such as invalid input from the user.
